# TerriblePhoneNumber

This was built as a joke competition that Code Network in Brisbane was running one afternoon, 
to design the worst phone number inputter. 

It was created very, very early in the web development learning process but has been refined 
a little since being created. 

You need 10 numbers to successful submit. 

Purely font-end only.
